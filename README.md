# Reaction-Time-Test
(Photon) Button based timer that measures reaction time and uploads all the variants to a web page

When the user presses the start button, after a random amount of time the green led will light and the buzzer will sound. The user needs to hit the stop button as soon as possible.

Once they stop the timer, their times will be saved and made available on repl.it
